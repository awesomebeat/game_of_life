<h3><b>The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton.</b></h3>

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. Player interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

So, basically, all you have to do is run the code and redirect the initial file to the input stream. Enjoy!
